<p>A history painting by Gerhard Richter</p>
<p>-Robert StorrThe destruction of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York on September 11,
2001 was an outrage of shattering audacity, scale, and originality. In monstrosity still echoes,
still defines the imagination, and still stirs a stormcloud of mixed emotion. If, as Robert Storr
writes, the finest contemporary art is a means for contemplating the unanswered and sometimes
unanswerable paradoxes of modern life, then 9/11 is its most demanding possible challenge.
9/11 was not simply a uniquely shocking act of destructive violence. Unlike most violent events
it was designed to be witnessed, directly or indirectly, by the maximum possible number of
people all over the world. It was meant to be photographed, televised, and disseminated by the
wold’s media, and it was. Combined with the simultaneous attack on the Pentagon, it was
intended to symbolize the most radical possible upending of the existing order, the triumph, as
Storr puts it, of relative weakness against disproportionate strength. Storr analyses the very
different ways in which this symbolism was interpreted by different ways in which this
symbolism was interpreted by different groups. Particularly in the United States, 9/11 has
dominated, and sometimes distorted, discussions of both nation security and foreign policy and
it still remains and open wound, a source of range, pain, alienation and extreme anxiety.
In his remarkable treatise which opened the catalogue fir the great 2002 Moma exhibition,
Gerhard Richter: Forty Years of Painting, Robert Storr described Richter in these words. “A
broadly philosophical painter, more than a strictly conceptual one, a radical thinker, and often
traditional maker, among the great artist of the second half of the twentieth century, and a frontline explore of the twenty-first, Richter is an image struck poet of alertness and restraint, of
doubt and daring.”</p>
<p>Richter is not new to terror- related subject; his series on the Baader-Meinhof group that
terrorized Germany in the 1970s now hangs at Moma in New York, and at first caused much
controversy. 9/11 is in almost every way a far larger and more complex subject. Storr has called
on his unmatched knowledge of Richter’s work as well as his personal acquaintance with the
artist, to analyse both the painting of, and the philosophy behind his small but powerful painting,
<p>September.</p>
<p>Storr suggest why this ostensibly modest work has such subtle and incremental emotional
impact. He also meditates on how the process of producing it, literally by scraping away much
of the original painting and by muffing the earliest depiction of the fireball caused by collision
of plane and the tower, has deepened the meaning and impact of the work. The result, Robert
Storr writes, has been “to render the simple, absolute, but always, elusive reality of human
suffering.”</p>
<p>On Fine Morning</p>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>The subject of this essay is a single painting by Gerhard Richter: September. It was painted in
2005. four years after” the decisive moment” of September 11, 2001 that it arrests, holds in
perpetual suspension but refuses to embody. In the service of critical disinterestedness, many
art historians and other types of professional art writers might take a step back before discussing
such a work and start by adopting a voice reflecting some measure of detachment from the
matter at hand. In this case, that is impossible. Instead, I must begin by speaking in the first
person. This is necessary because the work under scrutiny focuses on thing I saw and heard,
things that happened to me or happened to others before my own eyes or within earshot. Beyond
that scope, it concerns things that happened to people I know who told me with little or no delay
what they had seen and heard and said and thought and felt during the same day or in the days
immediately after it, days that are fused in memory like clear glass bottles melted into one
another by a searing heat that partially coated them with ash.</p>
<p>Although I believed at the tome that what I had witnessed would be indelibly etched in my
mind, since then I have been forced to contend with the ways those traces are now crowded by,
and to a certain extent conflated with, the thousands of other images of the same situation seen
from different angles through different lenses. Some of these second-hand images I have
glimpsed in passing once or twice, some I have been confronted with dozens if not hundreds of
times, and still others I have poured over for hours during the eight years since 9/11/01. The
paradox embodied in each of those picture is exponentially amplified by their aggregate. Its
essence emerges with the realization the closer those picture appear to bring to me to aspect of
what I directly saw, albeit from a considerable physical remove and form only a couple of
vantage points, the father away my experience of that day seems to become, the more remote
and – when such an image roughly approximates my own recollection – the less sharply defined
even my most vivid recollections are. Of course, this is a paradox at the core of every
representation, but it is starkest and most resonant for those who can compare a given deception
of a phenomenon to their memory of this unmediated perception.
If, in order to address Richter’s painting, I am obliged to consider the public iconography of
9/11/01 and that iconography’s larger context as the work’s inseparable background, prior to
fulfilling that obligation I am compelled to account for my own metal snapshots, those frozen
glimpses of reality that are effectively the background. Yet the particularities of such retinal
imprints and their psychological and intellectual impact remain so fresh and so profound that
they still refuse to fall into place behind the other two representational orders, even when they
boundary between the first hand impression and those two orders begin to blur.
This residual, intransigent vividness triangulates the familiar binary tensions in Richter’s art
between the photograph and the painted picture. Moreover, it adds a third term generally not at
issue in his other picture. Moreover, it adds a third term generally not at issue in his other works.
This is true because the scenes he has habitually chosen to recreate in the past derive for the
most part from found sources – family pictures, newspaper items, landscapes, aerial cityscapes
– that contain few if any people who were unlikely to have seen by more than a handful of on
– lookers when the image was captured. The exceptions are picture of larger clusters, groups or
crowds of people; but more often than not, the situation ‘s center of attention is ambiguous,
making each person’s specific relations to that ill- defined center and to other individuals inside
or outside the frame almost impossible to discern and harder still to compare.
Not so with the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11/01. That morning, masses of the
people were suddenly caught up in a highly concentrated event in which everyone within visual
of its locus was both a protagonist and spectator. Many of those spectators had cameras or video
equipment, with the result that eye- witnesses without any conventional reportorial role to play
were nevertheless recording history and generating the secondary images that would at once
complete and complete with that others who were also eye-witnesses were documenting at the
same instant, along with the still greater number who watched but made no permanent record.
Within this constellation of participant/ observers could be found every imaginable type of New
Yorker as well as a host of non- New Yorkers. It was a collective whose only, common
denominator was being there – then.</p>
<p>On the morning of 9/11/01 I found myself in an outer ring of the circles radiating around what
was soon to be known a Ground Zero. While I could see nothing of what occurred at street
level, I had an unimpeded view of the upper floors of the World Trade Center (WTC). My
neighbourhood was is Brooklyn, right across the East River from the Financial District of lower
Manhattan. Some of my neighbours were en route to work or already at work in the vicinity of
the WTC when disaster hit. As such, my family, our friends, and I were nodes in the tessellated
pattern of watchers just described; and insofar as we were straight downwind from the noxious
plume of smoke and debris that blew from the west when the towers burned and ultimately
collapsed, we also had a bitter taste of the holocaust that transfixed us.
Taking into account the compound stimuli – the acrid odor the smouldering ruins, the sirens,
the unfolding vision and growing intuition of horror – coupled with an acute though imprecise
awareness of my own potential vulnerability and that of others who shared the experience at
different proximities to the greatest dangers, as well as a simultaneous awareness of the
fundamental incommensurability of the degrees of that core, the conceptual distinction between
objectivity and subjectivity, distance and lack of distance lose their precession. And, in the
jarring unpredictability of circumstance, they also lose a good deal of their meaning. As much
as anything, that loss of bearings, those imploding distinctions are what most shocked my
nervous system and permanently alerted my consciousness. So, before trying to describe
Richer’s September, its genesis, its place within oeuvre, it unique status among images of
9/11/01, and its significate to contemporary art, I will tell the reader what the sights and sounds
of that day were when disaster struck.</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>This narrative portion will be fragmentary. Its contents are the metal snapshots of which I have
just spoken, ot in some cases metal videos and in other mentally recorded telephone
conservations. All events and impressions are rendered as accurately as memory permits and
with maximum concision. None are embellished by second thoughts or ex post facto insights,
although a few factual detail I learned later have been added. Any interpretive elaborations of
my own experience that are germane to the larger points I wish to make in this essay will appear
later on.</p>
<p>September 11, 2001 was the first day of fall classes for my two daughter. My wife walked them
to school at seven forty-five. I remained at home. Twenty minutes after I finished The New
York Times and sat down to write, the windows next to my desk shuddered, and I felt a distant
concussion. That was unusual; but in our pat of the city, near the Brooklyn – Queens
Expressway, the Brooklyn – Battery Tunnel, and the dock, collisions and other loud noises are
not entirely out of the ordinary. Just as my wife got home from dropping the girls off, the phone
rang. When she answered, a friend living nearby exclaimed, “Oh my God, there’s a fire at the
Word Trade Center! We can see it from here.” (At 8:45, American Airelines Flight 11 from
Boston ploughed into the North Tower and disintegrated.) In another room, my wife turned the
television to the local news, and shortly after beckoned me to join her. The reception was bad,
since we lacked cable; and so, because we eager to know what was going on, we went down
the block to join our friend in her brownstone. While we were walking the four block, a second
plane hit the WTC. (It was United Airlines Flight 175, also from Boston which crashed into the
South Tower at 9:03 and exploded on impact.)</p>
<p>Upon arriving at our friend's house, which overlooked the East River, we went straight to the
fourth floor and clambered out a window onto the steel grate of the fire escape. From there we
had a direct view of the Twin Towers silhouetted against a clear sky. Both towers had scorched
sides, and one had a gaping black cavity that was plainly visible to the naked eye. We weren't
able to see---as those in Manhattan only a few city blocks away from the WTC readily could--
-the men and women who, gasping for air, stuck their heads and bodies out of the broken
windows and vainly tried to escape the inferno within. Neither could we see those who jumped
in desperation; nor could we hear the ghastly sound of bodies landing on the pavement as many
in lower Manhattan did, including close friends who described the appalling sight to me.
From our observation post in Brooklyn, we could see smoke rising from the two towers as if
from gigantic candles. What looked like white seagulls swirled around them, although, in fact,
this was a cloud of paper wafting from the fractured facade of the buildings and carried aloft
by a strong breeze. Except for the smoke and that scintillating cloud, the sky was a
breathtakingly pure azure.</p>
<p>After watching the towers burn for a quarter of an hour or so, we went downstairs to see if we
could learn from the television what was going on. The newscasters went Himire themselves;
but after initial specula-- don that a private plane had strayed into the WTC, it became obvious
that the double calamity was no accident. Two other planes south of New York that were,
apparently, of course were being carefully tracked.</p>
<p>As soon as it was confirmed that some kind of attack was under way, we called our daughters’
school and learned that the principal had gathered students into an assembly. Shortly after our
call, we saw the South Tower implode on television, after much guesswork by newscasters
about the WTC’s structure and strength. (The towers were designed to withstand a direct hit by
a fully fuelled 707, but the planes that were used were larger and heavier than that.) The collapse
came at 10:5, just over an hour after the first strike. Meanwhile, the assembly at our daughter’
school was dismissed and classroom television were turned on, around which student and
teacher crowded. The school was ten blocks from were my wife and I and only a few short
miles as the crow files from the WTC, in around which the parents pf many other student
worked.</p>
<p>After a second call the school agreed to release children to their families and promised to
provide for those whose families could not come to pick them up. When we arrived, a number
of student were running hysterically trough the hallways. We found our daughters in the
school’s lobby. Our nine years – old was distraught because the mother of her best friend was
a senior staffer of the New York and New Jersey Port Authority that had built, still operated,
and had its main offices in the WTC. Both daughter had been watching the image on television.
‘All there was, was smoke,” the youngest remembered. “People were taking pictures and they
were just pictures of smoke.”</p>
<p>By this time air in our neighbourhood was filled with ash, scraps of paper blowing in the wind,
and the heavy pall of a chemical or electrical fire. To protect our daughters as best we could
while walking away from the school, we asked them to cover their mouths with some
handkerchiefs I pulled from my pocket. My wife and I did the same, using only our hand. Even
across the river from the WTC the atmosphere was almost suffocating. Yet only that stench and
knowledge of its source prevented me from wondering at the beauty of the flurry of gray and
white particles and kiting tatters.</p>
<p>We returned to the house of our friends with the fire – escape view and discovered that members
of several other families had joined them. Together we watched the North Tower fall. ( It
happened at 10:28) I did not know then Michael Richards, a young artist I had met while
installing exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, had spent the night in a studio atop the
WTC made available to him by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. One of this sculptures
was a cast of his own body covered by toy airplanes. He vanished when the North Tower
buckled and sank its foundations.</p>
<p>Interspersed with on-site television coverage of event in New York were reports of the two
other hijackings. The first, we learned, involved American Airlines Flight 77 from New York,
which had slammed into the Pentagon in Washington D.C. at 9:43. The second involved United
Airlines Flight 93 out of Newark, which crashed mysteriously at 11:26 in a rural area south
Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>One of the friends watching the news with us was a nurse at St. Vincent’s Hospital on 12th
Street and Seventh Avenue is Manhattan, just north of the WTC. Although it was her day off
and travel to Manhattan was extremely difficult, not to mention perilous, she decided to go into
work in anticipation of casualties arriving at the Emergency Room she supervised. Later in the
day, she called to say that none had arrived, indicating the enormity and completeness of the
losses.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the morning, I headed home on foot to close the windows. (For the next
months doors stayed shut and windows were firmly sealed at our house despite intermittently
warm and pleasant weather and government, assurances that the fumes from continual fires in
the WTC ruins posed no health hazards.) Before locking the backdoor of our brownstone, I
walked around the garden behind it. The ground was covered with airborne litter. Most of the
bits and pieces of paper were from business manuals and spreadsheets. One that I picked up
was a page from history of the Civil War dealing the Battle of Antietam.
From a chance meeting on the street with the father and sister of our younger daughter’s best
friend, I learned that her mother had gone to the polls to vote in a primary election prior to
healing into Manhattan and so had not been at the WTC at the usual hours. Invited by them to
their house, I found the mother on the telephone trying to determine who among her co-workers
had been at the office when the attack begin and how many managed to escape. One of her
colleagues who was wheelchair bound had been carried to safety just prior to the North Tower’s
collapse. The mother devoted most of the rest of the day to locating the remainder of her coworkers and making a list of those unaccounted for. During the course of the afternoon, she
went out to the stoop in front of her house and recognised papers from her office that had blown
over the river and landed there.</p>
<p>At the end of the afternoon my eldest daughter and a group of their fiends walked back up to
the promenade in Brooklyn Heights that overlooks the financial district of downtown
Manhattan across the East River. Several nights later it would be the site of a candle light vigil
the entire family attended. In the fading hours of 9/11/01 she watched the smoke rising from
and hanging over the ruins of the Twin Towers and the glow of search lamps trained on them.
Thinking back on it years later she recalled with visible uneasiness that she was excited by the
vista. For the first time in her life she was present as a part of history.
The specifics and chronology of much of the rest of the happened on 9/11/01 remain elusive,
but a few more details from it and the days following stand out.
Despite a recent influx of upper-middle-class people of various origins and professions that had
gradually changed the character and complexion of the previously working class
neighbourhood where we live, our community was populated by several readily identifiable
ethnic groups. The largest element was first-, second- or third-generation Italian-Americans
with roots in Puglia and Sicily. After that came Hispanic-Americans from different countries
as well as African-Americans, many of whom live in housing projects at the edge of the area.
There is also a sizable Arab-American contingent. Most of the latter group consists of new
arrivals from Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, but some who have come from these places
settled in Brooklyn long ago.</p>
<p>A high percentage of the older Arab-American immigrants are Maronite Christians, but the
majority of the more recent ones are Muslims. A considerable portion of the latter dress in
traditional grab with the men wearing skullcaps and he women and girls wearing head scarves.
Arabic is heard frequently on the street. Atlantic Avenue, a main thoroughfare that crosses the
neighbourhood west to east, boasts restaurants, coffee – houses, grocery stores, bakeries,
clothing stores, and general emporia that sell everything from utensils and luggage to knickknacks, hookahs, and rugs. There you can also find decorative carpets and objects featuring
architectural monuments and famous mosques in the Middle East, secular music and films and
recorded sermons and religious tracts, including those of Osama Bin Landen’s spiritual and
political mentor, Muhammed Qutb.</p>
<p>The cultural continuum spanning the Arab-American stretch of Atlantic Avenue is market at
one end by well –established gourmet market Sahadis and at the other end by the Al Farooq
Mosque, where the blind cleric Sherik Omar Abdel Rahman held forth before he was arrested
and tried for complicity in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, an attack planned by
Khaild Shaikh Mohammed, who also masterminded the second and successful attempt to bring
down the WTC.</p>
<p>Sometimes during the day or day immediately following the attack on the WTC, blue police
barricades went up in front of businesses owed by Arab- Americans near the intersection of
Atlantic Avenue and Court Street. I stumbled on them while running an errand. However, in
spite of the shockwaves set in motion by the events 9/11/01, the tensions crated by the political
rhetoric already beginning to influence public perception of the event, and the degree to which
the calamity became an intimate matter in every corner of our neighbourhood (local fire stations
and police precincts that sent firemen and officers across the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges
to the WTC had suffered heavy casualties), there were no reprisals against the local Arab
community. Thus the police barriers were tangible evidence of something terrible that did not
happen.</p>
<p>On September 17, 2001, President George Bush went to television to name Osama Bin Laden
as the man behind the assault of the week before. “I want justice,” Bush decelerated. By way
of emphasis he added, “And there’s an old poster out West, I recall, that says, ‘Wanted: Dead
or Alive.”With barely a second’s pause, our youngest, still badly shaken but media-savvy
daughter responded, “I bet he’s been waiting his whole life to say that!”
From that press conference onward there was also much talk in the part of the President and
others in official capacities, about the hijackers of 9/11/01 having been “cowards”. In that
context, I got a telephone call from my father, who has served in the United States Army Air
Force during World War II and who had witnessed kamikaze pilots in action. He expressed
deep distaste for such statements. As best I can recall, his words were, “We hated the kamikazes
and we feared them, but we never thought they were cowards. Men who kill themselves trying
to kill you are not cowards.”</p>
<p>Around the same time, I received a call from my aunt, who was born in Germany to a Jewish
father and a Gentile mother. She had lived incognito in Berlin and Bavaria until the end of
World War II and had experienced both the threat of being exterminated by the Nazis and the
terror of saturation bombing by the Allies. Ever alert to the harsh lessons of that experience,
she expressed deep concern for what had happened on 9/1 /oi but noted that the actual toll of
death and destruction was a fraction of what she had known in her youth. Furthermore, she
pointed out that until this happened, few civilians in America had ever been targets of an
implacable enemy, and none had had such an enemy come to their doorstep. As shocking as the
attacks were she warned, we must riot lose our sense of proportion, lest exaggeration and
overreaction further imperil, or even pervert, the America where she had sought and found safe
haven.</p>
<p>On September 13, 2001, Gerhard Richter was scheduled to appear at the opening of an
exhibition of his new paintings at the Marian Goodman Gallery in Manhattan. At 8:45 AM on
9/11/01, when the first plane crashed into the World Trade Center, Richter and his wife Sabine
were on Lufthansa flight 408 from Cologne, scheduled to land in Newark at 12:30 PM. At 10:24
the Federal Aviation Authority closed air space over the United State and diverted incoming
transatlantic traffic to Canada. Richter’s plane landed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and he and his
wife returned to Cologne on the 13th.</p>
Chapter 3</p>
<p>On 9/ 11 /01, tens of thousands-if not hundreds of thousands-saw, or at last caught a glimpse
of, the catastrophe at the World Trade Center. They were on the street or in buildings nearby;
they watched from office block and skyscrapers further uptown, or looked down the wide
thoroughfare from Seventh Avenue to the West Side Highway; they stood at the water's edge,
on promenades and docks, in parks, in ware house, in apartments, and on roof tops; on the
Hudson River and the East River or on Staten Island, Governors Island, and Ellis Island. Some
were in boats in New York Harbor. Until air space over the city was shut off, some were in
planes and helicopters. I have described where I was and what I observed and thought. All other
eyewitnesses had their own vantage points and their own reactions.
The differences among their experiences and narratives aren't like the self-interested retellings
of an intimate confrontation explored by Akira Kurosawa in his many-sided film Rashomon.
Yet divergences and distortions of varying kinds enter into the story of 9/11/01 because from
beginning to end the event was exhaustively documented from multiple angles. At the outset
these differences were relatively little influenced by overt political considerations. That came
later, albeit not much later, given the accelerating rhythms of the daily news cycle in times of
crisis and the speculations that substitute for facts as breaking stories are patched together by
talking heads. For the first hour and thirty-eight minutes of the crisis, most reports centered on
sketchy information from people on the spot or near it as well as from agencies charged to
respond to the emergency that had rushed representatives to the scene. As the nature of the
emergency fully revealed itself and police, firemen and rescue workers attempting to get near
the site crossed paths with victims or potential victims hastening to leave it, the number of
people in a position to say "I saw it happen” swelled, only to be partially decimated when the
denouement came and the fall of the two towers buried two thousand seven hundred and fiftytwo people. One person close to the scene at the very end saw another man a little closer still
who raised his arm and spasmodically shook his wrist at the billowing dust about to engulf him;
the observer realized that the man was in a hysterical state and was desperately attempting to
witch off reality with an imaginary remote control wand, and so at the flick of his finger, trying
not be there and not to see it happen.</p>
<p>Among the most horrific and moving of testimony was that of office workers trapped on the
upper floors of each tower who somehow managed to telephone family, friends, and others
before their death. In most respects, the first public reports of the disaster were much like those
of other crises in that the primary questions concerned what had caused it, how bad it was, or
how bad it would get. Except for officials with privileged data about the buildings, the planes,
the available resources, the pace of rescue operations and what was actually happening within
the WTC-to the extent that anyone had comprehensive knowledge about that-all there was to
go by was what the eye could see. One's perspective on the calamity was quite literally confined
to optical phenomena.</p>
<p>Politics entered the equation once those scant facts about the perpetrators that were available,
coupled with stock characterizations of them a categorically Other, made it open season for
ethnic and ideological stereotypes; once the rhetoric of "the global war on terror" began to
reduce the crucial distinctions between Sunni and Shia, Iraq and Iran, Osama Bin Laden and
Saddam Hussein to a cratered Ground Zero of historical an analysis and critical thinking; and
one questions about ,who should have anticipated the attack or, in fact, did anticipated ' it but
failed to act, were raised. The simultaneous and contradictory processes of investigation and
mystification set in motion by such confusion are too vast to address in depth here. Inevitably,
though, they contribute to the meaning of any image of the besieged Twin Towers to the extent
that ever since the attack the Pandora's box of political and cultural spectres released by it have
hovered in the air like the fluttering nimbus of paper that briefly arose over the actual site.
Unlike that nimbus, these specters have yet to dissipate and so continue to obscure our view of
the event and its meanings.</p>
<p>In the initial stage of the attack on through the complete demise of the WTC the major basis of
difference among those who saw it happen were physical degrees of separation, qualified by
differences in their immediate stake in the outcome and fundamental differences in social
identity and psychological resilience . Who actually died, who risked death, who endured the
death of someone close to them, who feared for their own lives or that of someone else, and for
how long during the day or the days following did that fear possess them? Who lost a job or an
apartment or, in some subtler or more insidious manner, lost a defining illusion and so lost a
way of life? In short, what kind of trauma was visited upon each and every person whose eyes
were trained on the WTC or as much of it as they could make out depending on their vantage
point?</p>
<p>Given those differences, to whom does the destruction of the WTC "belong" as an existential
reality or as an image? The intensity of feeling surrounding that question can be measured in
the aching voices of those who have read aloud the names of their dead on September 11th of
every year since the attack, just as the viciousness of those names and of the faces of those who
recite them make plain that true "Americaness” is neither monochrome nor monocultural.
Rather, as Walt Whitman so clearly saw it, America is a multitude of differences. That intensity
is also manifest in the emotionally charged debate over what constitutes a fitting monument t
to the victims of the attack and the lack of agreement even among those who suffered most
grievously and mourn most bitterly. On that score, one should be alert to the emergence or a
psychological phenomenon largely new to Americans, but deeply in grained in those who have
had their reality blown apart or slowly obliterated: survivor guilt. Much of the passionate
contention over the memorializing of 9/11/01 has come from people who escaped the fate that
befell the person sitting or standing or running next to them, in the other office or by the elevator
or no the stairs, or out on the sidewalk in the shadow of the crumbling towers. This guilt extends
to those who never came near the scene but cannot forget their intimacy with others who never
left it. Even as they ask, “Why him? Why her?” in reference to a family member, friend, or coworker who was lost, they are implicitly asking, “Why not me? What did I do to deserve life?
How in the world could someone else have deserved death?” In survivor guilt, relief and regret
become excruciatingly, inextricably knotted, and the simple fact of not having died when others
did can become a lifetime curse.</p>
<p>At the heart of the debates over formal remembrance are three irreconcilable factors. First, there
is an implicit, if not explicit, quantification of pain, the invidious comparison of degrees of
anguish. Second, there is a desire to ennoble those who perished by raising a memorial that
speaks to their "heroism," even though the majority of those who died did so without having
chosen any aspect of their deaths as heroes traditionally do. Nevertheless, from the accounts we
have, many people at the scene acted bravely and some with astonishing and truly selfless
courage in the face of circumstances all but entirely beyond their control. Their actions, and
their sacrifices do give heroic dimensions to the ordeal both individually and collectively.
The third factor is patriotism. In the search for meaning in death, love of country historically
takes precedence over other considerations once it enters into discussion, and that process had
moved commemoration of the victims of the WTC attack to the brink of making innocent
civilians, policeman, and fireman into the fir t front-line casualties of a national battle for
survival. As in any similar situation, "the fallen" become sacred to the cause, and deciding upon
the appropriate rituals for remembering them becomes a struggle among the social, cultural,
religious, and ideological values of those who see themselves as their rightful heirs or
spokespersons. Nevertheless, within the diverse group of those who bore the brunt of 9/11/01 ,
there is still no unity about the significance of the losses everyone experienced, because there
is still no agreement on what the overarching principles being enshrined really are, not least of
them being the substance of allegiance to the principles of the "founding fathers" in a context
where civil liberties guaranteed in the Constitution they wrote are being systematically violated
in the name of national honor and national self-defense by those in authority who arrogate to
themselves "emergency" powers never contemplated by the Constitution's framers.
The cruel reality is that the only deaths that have unequivocal meaning are those of the AJ -
Qaeda squads who executed the operation. The planners for whom they served as human
weapons made a study of the circumstances in which their common adversary-the United States
and the secular political and economic modeI of modernity of which America is, for them, the
epitome-could be caught off guard and profoundly wounded. By fulfilling that plan,
Mohammed Atta and his men realized a destiny they had elected, confident that the enormous
constituency of disaffected people they hoped to simultaneously address and speak for by their
actions would instantly understand and at heart endorse, if not publicity embrace, their ultimate
gesture. Their goal was singular, their rationale desperately coherent, and their devotion to it all
consuming. That is the totalizing intent and effect of declaring “jihad” against the supposed
enemies of Islam.</p>
<p>However, the historical concept of “jihad” lacks a counterpart in our society, despite that fact
that in post-Cold War era there has been no shortage of attempts to impose a comparably
simplistic definition of “them and “us” on the manifest complexity of worldwide modernity,
especially when it comes to societies with large Muslim populations. Among the most pervasive
and problematic examples of such reductive thinking has been the hypothetical “clash of
civilizations” posited by the historian of Arab culture Bernard Lewis and the political scientise
Samuel P. Huntington. One need not be a specialist in these fields to find ample reasons to
worry about the popularization of the logic and motives behind the declaration of their ideas.
Nor must one be an international security expert to question the logic and motives behind the
declaration of a "global war on terror. Indeed, the sweeping generalizations used to buttress
such sloganeering strike many serious observers (and none more eloquently expresses his
double than the deeply knowledgeable former Under Secretary General of the United Nations
for Peacekeeping, Sir Brian Urquhart) as an inherently self-defeating approach to the threat
posed to the United State by the wide array of military or paramilitary forces that have at one
time or another launched an assault on identifiably American targets abroad or contemplated –
and in the instance of 9/11/01 succeeded in – launching such an assault on our soil. To the
contrary, the multiplicity of those enemies and their aims precludes any unifying label for them
and any unified strategy for dealing with them. “Terror” is a tactic, not an ideology. Its use does
not define any antagonistic community sufficiently to distinguish that community from all
others that might take similar actions. This is especially true when we know so many
communities that are violently "anti-American" yet do not get along with each other despite
nominally shared political, cultural, or religious, values. The plural nature of the wars that have
been declared against the United State by such communities is indisputable, but the fact that
several of these wars merge in the netherworlds of finance and arms trading and have been
branded "jihad" does not make them the same war any more than adding the prefix pan- to the
collective nouns Arab or Islam has brought those masses who identify themselves as either into
harmony with each other, despite the fact that this has long been the dream of fundamentalist
of every stripe fighting their "last battle" against former colonial or present neocolonial powers.
While Atta and the other hijackers who destroyed the WTC were, in their minds, at war with a
country they believed was at war with their faith, it does not follow that defending oneself
against them entails engaging in a symmetrical conflict based on crude binaries.
Rather, the asymmetrical nature of terrorism derives partly from the discrepancy that "they" are
indeed at war with "us," yet neither "they" nor "we" can be summed up by such a juxtapositionno matter how hard - line ideologues and opinion-makers on both sides insist on such
Manichean distinctions. Outside the domain of propaganda and those enthralled by it, Atta and
his cohort do not represent the Islamic world. Nevertheless, their goal was to make a grand
gesture that would rally millions of people angry at the United States to an image of its
unacknowledged vulnerability. To that end they produced a horrendous spectacle that was
intended by them to be photographed, televised, and disseminated by the ·world's media,
starting with the media of the nation they attacked. Which it was.</p>
Employing the most unlikely of means – taking command of a fully loaded aircraft with box –
cutters and applying learned in commercial flight – training courses – they turned the
technology of an advanced industrial society against itself, firstly by selecting a target built to
the structural limits of modern architecture and engineering secondly, by using commercial
airlines as bombs; and thirdly, by making certain that virtually everyone on the planet would
see what they did within minutes hours, or, at most, days of their doing it . Strategically, the
attacks of 9/11/01 were a stroke of malevolent genius, the leveraging of relative weakness
against disproportionate strength, a kind of jiu-jitsu of guerrilla warfare in which the
superiorities of the attacker's adversary are used against that adversary. Semiotically speaking,
the effective vaporization of a building that proclaimed itself a center, if not the center, of world
trade, as well as the partial obliteration of another, the Pentagon, which is the headquarters of
the world’s greatest military power, combined with the global broadcast of the former, resulted
in a sudden inversion of symbols never before seen on such a scale or simultaneously by so
many people.</p>
<p>The almost instantaneous reaction to the attacks tested the ambivalent attitudes much of the
world's population has toward the United States. And if expression of sorrow and sympathy
were swift in arriving from abroad, equally quick to register were the mixed emotions others
felt at watching the emblems of a country they had admired and envied and sometimes loathed
from afar brought low by a few well-executed blows. And then, of course there were those
around the world who loudly cheered at such a public humbling of an empire. That cheering
has not stopped, and its jarring echoes are perhaps the hardest thing to reckon with for American
who have always thought of themselves as the benevolent and generous protagonist of
modernity, especially when those echoes resound in places that Americans have taken for
granted as friendly.</p>
<p>One day in Paris, I met a chic Frenchwoman I know. I noticed that she was carrying a woven
grass basket which she said she'd picked up at a market in Pakistan. On it was a stylish folk art
design representing two planes hitting the Twin Towers. The woman does not hate America,
but neither is she shy about distancing herself from it when she wishes to make a point of her
differences with our preconceptions and way of life. Nor, as it turned out, was she immune to
a type of schadenfreude that most of her American colleagues would find distasteful, as I myself
did since I could not look at the bag's cartoon version of the scene without it triggering my own
memories. Was it because of this woman-or rather of the attitude she personified-that French
fries were renamed "Freedom fries" during the hysteria that swept America from the aftermath
of the attacks, when the President told the world on November 6th, 2001, "You're either with
us or against us in the fight against terror?" 5 to the launching of a war in Iraq that was
predicated on a bogus link between the far flung aggressions of a network of religiously pious
fanatics and the regional ambition of an Arab Socialist tyrant.
Perhaps; but then, think of the contemporary Afghan rugs emblazoned with schematic
renderings of Soviet armaments and portraits of Lenin, /Stalin, Brezhnev, and the Russian
puppet Mohammad Najibullah that chic Americans buy for their floors. The comparison is not
between the system of government in the US and former USSR but between the ways in which
the gruesomeness of warfare is repacked as kitsch and savoured with cheap triumphalism in
places far from the bloodletting.</p>
<p>The irony deeply woven into these rugs is that the “friendly” mujahedeen freedom fighters who
drove the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan with the help of America training and supplies
quickly morphed into the "unfriendly" and suddenly incomprehensibly alien religious
fundamentalist when the guerrillas turned their weapons on others they viewed as a threat to
the integrity of the nation-state they had fought for. The forces the United States had backed
against the expansion of Communism included not only indigenous democratic factions but
also autocratic warlords and ardent theocrats enthralled by an expansionist Pan-Islamic dream,
not the least among them being the former CIA "asset" Osama Bin Laden. However, if such
invisible threads of expedient affiliation and predictable disaffection have become the snares
embedded in shortsighted policies-"blow back" is the current euphemism of preference- the
crux of the difference between how Russians and Americans might regard defeat in the Great
Game of Central Asian domination has everything to do with an American tendency to view
Russia's extraterritorial engagements as "imperial adventures" while refusing to view its own
forays into other countries in the same terms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the profound shock Americans experienced on 9/11/01 and the psychic tremors
that continue to shake the country stern 1Il large measure from perspectives that view the United
State as a permanent exception to historical forces and vulnerabilities. For few Americans
besides veterans or those who have fled to this country from other zones of conflict have
participated in or seen war up close. Moreover, not since the Vietnam War have Americans
been mocked while licking their wounds, and never before have the wounded been the man and
woman on the street.</p>
<p>Some of what seemed to be mockery but was not necessarily intended as such resulted from
reflex responses to the purely spectacular aspects on the attack. They were a product of a
saturation of the senses and an evacuation of common sense that is all too familiar in the media
age. They also stemmed from an anesthetization of violence that conflates art and life in ways
that only the glib, the cynical, or the supremely detached can imagine. Such was the reaction of
the German avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, who notoriously proclaimed the fall
of the Twin Towers “the greatest work of art that is possible in the whole cosmos.”
On the one hand, the recognition that solidarity with the United States in its moment of crisis
was not universal profoundly upset many Americans, and it further exacerbated inward –
turning nationalism in some sectors of the population. Such nationalism took one of its most
extreme forms in commentary by the far-right –wing firebrand, Ann Coulter.
This is no time to be precious about locating the exact individuals involved in this particular
terrorist attack. Those responsible include anyone anywhere in the world who smiled in
response to the (9/11 attack)… We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert
them to Christianity. We weren’t punctilious about locating and publishing only Hitler and his
top officers. We carpet – bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That’s war. And this is
war.</p>
On the other hand, America’s status as a country that had not previously experienced a
cataclysm like the one that occurred on 9/11/01, and an attack on the chauvinism that once
attended its now shattered sense of “exceptionalism” were, if anything, a provocation of people
who felt that the United Sates was at last beginning to learn the hard way what they themselves
had long since forced to learn. (Stockhausen, who was in his teens when the Allied saturation
bombing of Germany took place, seemed to have forgotten the lesson, or sublimated it in an
inexplicable and apparently uncomprehending dandyism.)
In the grip of contradictory impulses and responses, shock and amazement, anger and hurt, the
desire to ascribe a fixed, collective significance to the events of 9/11/01 was frustrated from the
outset. Instead various degrees of alienation from the rest of the world and anxiety within that
isolation seized hold and stretched emotions and attitudes to the outer reaches of most
Americans’ experience and tolerance. Which then snapped back, often suddenly, often
irrationally.</p>
The furore over Susan Sontag's The New Yorker magazine essay on the disparity between the
wild but all too predictable declarations of many American leaders and the new situation with
which we were brutally but undeniably confronted on that fateful morning is symptomatic of
such a retreat from reality into rhetoric. Prior to quoting Sontag, I would like to underscore the
last lines of this passage and note that the view she espoused and for which she was vilified by
the "patriotic" press was the previously cited judgment I heard from a World War II veteranmy father-a week before her words were published.
The disconnect between last Tuesday's monstrous dose of reality and the self-righteous drivel
and outright deceptions being peddled by public figures and TV commentators is startling,
depressing. The voices licensed to follow the event seem to have joined together in a campaign
to infantilize the public. Where is the acknowledgement that this was not a "cowardly" attack
on "civilization" or "liberty" or "humanity" or "the free world" but an attack on the world ' selfproclaimed super-power, undertaken as a consequence of specific American alliances and
actions? How many citizens are aware of the ongoing American bombing of Iraq? And if the
word “cowardly” is to be used, it might be more aptly applied to those who kill from beyond
the range of retaliation, high in the sky, than to those willing to die themselves in order to kill
others. In the matter of courage (a morally neutral virtue): whatever may be said of the
perpetrators of Tuesday’s slaughter, they were not cowards.</p>
The heated condemnation of Sontag's sceptical essay was a harbinger of the rapid politicization
of 9/11/01 and the scramble to claim it for conservative causes in the early phases of George
W. Bush's first term as President. That rush to judge the patriotism of people and their position
on "the war again terror" by their inferred attitudes toward what had happened that day did not
spare Gerhard Richter or his work.</p>
The target of opportunity was the inclusion of his cycle of paintings October 18, 1977 (1988)
in a retrospective of the artist's work, Gerhard Richter: Forty Years of Painting, that opened at
the Museum of Modem Art in October 2002, which was just over a year after 9/11/01. Once
again I must step forward rather than back, because the polemic that arose when the paintings
were shown focused directly on me as the curator of that show and author of the catalog, as
well as of a separate monograph on the cycle. It was not the first time since these paintings were
initially presented in Germany, that intense controversy had flared up, however the nature of
this incendiary outburst was distinctly American and a key to the temper of the times, given
that the same group was shown at MoMA without any such furor in 2000, several years after
the museum had acquired them.</p>
<p>The October paintings concern the violently contradictory lives and the mysteriously violent
deaths of members of the so-called Baader-Meinhof group-the most notorious cell of the
Marxist Red Army Faction (RAF)-which operated as an armed guerilla band in West Germany
from 1970 to 1977 with survivors and spin-offs continuing their activities into the next decade.
Ulrike Meinhof, one of the two leaders, came from a family that had been anti-Nazi during the
war. She herself had become a pacifist student organizer and journalist during the old War of
the 1950s and 1960s. Her gradual drifting to revolutionary Marxism and precipitous plunge in
to revolutionary terrorism fascinated and disturbed Richter. Born only two years before her, the
artist had experienced both the Hitler era, during which he was a school boy and his family was
largely pro-Nazi, and East German communism, during which he came of age as a young
socialist realist painter, from a very different vantage point than Meinhof.</p>
<p>In her tiny cohort, Richter identified an example of radical idealism gone horrifyingly wrong.
In essence, his subject was not so much the Baader- Meinhof group per se as the existential
causes and consequences of ideology. Asked in1989 if he has sympathy gor the Raf’s politics,
Richter replied that his own position was far from theirs:</p>
<p>I have always rejected it as an ideology, as Marxism or the like. What interests me is son1ething
different, as I've just tried to say: the why and wherefore of an ideology that has such an effect
on people; why we have ideologies at all; whether this is an inevitable, a necessary part of our
make-up-or a pointless one, a mere hindrance, a menace to live, a delusion.
He went on to say that the same "overriding, ideological motivation ," produces "tremendous
strength, the terrifying power that an idea has, which goes as far as death. That is the most
impressive thing, to me, and the most inexplicable thing; that we produce ideas, which are
almost always not only utterly wrong and nonsensical but above all dangerous.
Thus, for Richter, the tragic, self – deceptive extremism of the Baader-Mainhof episode was
symptomatic of the larger tragedy of totalizing ideology in twentieth – century Germany. But
as important to history and as bitter for him as those humanity of the people who succumbed to
them. The October cycle shuns any celebration of RAF’s action just as it eschews criticism of
those actions. What it commemorates with the heaviest of hearts and the fewest illusions is the
failure of the postwar generation to come adequately to terms with the profound wounds
inflicted on them and the horrendous burden left behind by the generations of the Third Reich
and Soviet – style Socialism.</p>
<p>Meinhof’s counterpart Andreas Baader, Baader’s lover and collaborator Gudurun Ensslin and
their comrade Jan – Carl Raspe died under obscure circumstances in Stuttgart’s Stammheim
Prison on the night of October 18. 1977. Their death were officially ruled as suicides, although
many people suspected state-mandated murder, despite the fact that the earlier demise of
Meinhof and of another member of the group, Holger Meins, who starved himself, are not in
doubt. In 1988, a decade after the grim finale in Stammheim, Rihter began a series of fifteen
grisaille pictures based on mass media and forensic photographs and video footage of the
events.</p>
<p>When the series was unveiled at the Museum Haus Esters in Krefeld in 1989, it sparked a
firestorm of criticism from both the Left and the Right. Predictably, the Right charged Richter
with overtly celebrating Communits with blood on their hands, even though he had left the
Communist East to come to the West in 1961 and had never expressed support of any kind for
Baader-Meinhof group's militancy while they carried on their insurrectionary underground
campaign as many other artists and intellectuals had done. Offering proof of Richter's distance
from their politics, the Left vociferously disputed the artist's "right" to portray their martyrs. In
ways that are unexpectedly congruent with some of the controversies around the
conlll1emoration of 9/11/ 01 that I have referred to above, the Left essentially claimed the entire
legacy of the Baader-Meinhof group for itself-including both the existing pictorial archive and
the freedom to make new pictures-while the Right found it impossible to accept that anyone
who was not an enemy of society as a whole could take an interest in those who had declared
themselves implacable enemies of the State.</p>
Equally inflammatory was the conclusion of an op-ed piece about the 2002 presentation of
Richter’s cycle that appeared in The Wall Street Journal on March 1 of that year. The author,
Eric Gibson, was a regular contributor to such mainstream art glossies as ART news and
Sculpture magazine and also wrote for the neo – conservative monthly The New Criterion,
which has long specialized in questioning the integrity – if not the patriotism – of those on the
opposite side of the “culture wars” with whom its critics disagree. On the editorial page of the
Journal, Gibson outdid himself. His charge is predicated on quotations taken out of context,
carefully abbreviated or otherwise reshaped to alert their meaning.
Altough too long to cite in full, here is the essence of that charge:
Sometimes art and life intersect in inconvenient ways, never more so than when the subject is
terrorism.</p>
<p>New York's museum of Modem Art has just opened Gerhard Richter: Forty Years of Painting,
a retrospective of a notable German contemporary artist. The show was organized by Robert
Storr, the museum's senior curator of painting and sculpture. It includes nearly 200 works, but
one is of special interest just now.</p>
October 18, 1977, painted in 1988, is a suite of 15 pictures whose subject is the Baader-Meinhof
Gang, the r96os radicals who constituted what was a German version of the Weather
Underground, only worse...</p>
<p>For his work, Mr. Richter drew on black-and-white news photos of the terrorists' capture, their
prison cells, their dead bodies and their funeral ... Though he himself has been careful in his
public statements not to endorse the Baader-Meinhof Gang-or condemn it-it is almost
impossible to see October 18, 1977 as anything but a series of martyr paintings, particularly
given the claims circulating at the time that the three terrorits were not suicides but the victims
of murderous authorities.</p>
<p>Two years ago, MoMA acquired October 18, 1977, displayed it for three months and published
a catalog written by Mr. Storr. One would think that whatever vestigial aura of romantic
rebellion that one hovered over the gang or other 1960s revolutionaries was blown away on
Sept. 11, when the brutality of terrorism hit home.</p>
<p>And yet... At the press conference for the current show, a questioner asked how Sept. 11 had
changed the meaning ofhe meaning of October 18, 1977. Here is Mr. Storr's reply:
"If you consider how the people involved in the attack on the World Trade Center were
characterized when it first happened, as if they were unknowably strange-fanatics that we could
somehow not fathom their thinking-and then you realize, in fact that some of the people
involved were middle-class, relatively speaking, educated people who, out of desperation, out
of anger, did horrific things then one of the things that the paintings represent [that] should be
present in our thinking about current events is that we are not dealing with monsters, we are not
dealing with people we do not know; we are dealing with people very much like ourselves."
Talk about moral equivalence! What kind of mind is it that, at this stage of the game, refuses to
distinguish between good and evil, between civilization and barbarism, and falls back on a
parody of inclusiveness-"people like us," driven by" desperation" and "anger"-to explain an
atrocity like Sept. 11 ? Perhaps it takes a mind that is still in thrall to the revolutionary ethos of
the 1960s counterculture …</p>
<p>[Storr] can't categorically condemn the Sept.11 terrorists because that would be a judgment on
the Baader-Meinhof Gang too, terror being indivisible. He can't condemn them because doing
so would amount to an indictment of the 1960s student movement as a whole. And that would
be an act of apostasy too awful for Mr. Storr even to contemplate.
In 2001 , terrorists murder 3 ,ooo of his fellow citizens in his own backyard. But all that really
counts for Mr. Storr is keeping alive the delusions of 1968.
I will not waste time here defending myself against the unsupported claims and calumnies of
an attack on me made almost ten years ago.
<p>Except to say that as someone on the Left I have opposed the use and romanticizing of violence
before, during, and after 1968 and that I have condemned and do condemn the course taken by
the Baader- Meinhof group, the Weartherman and all the course taken their ilk who steered
necessary but peaceful activism into the dead – end of extremism and brutality. The reason for
underscoring how easily “people very much like ourselves” become extremists is to underscore
how easily they slip into violence. It is crucial that we kept that process in mind if we ever hope
to understand terrorism. In recent years popular culture seems to have outstripped pundits like
Gibson in presenting such paradoxes to the general public, so that films like the political thrillers
Syriana (2008) and The Traitor (2008) and serious novels like Mohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant
Fundamentalist (2007) have managed to portray the temptations of terrorism currently alive in
the Muslim world through complex characters rather than through demons that caricature entire
cultures and causes.</p>
<p>The purpose of retrieving Gibson's hysterical misconstruction of my words and his equally
flawed reading of the October cycle is to demonstrate the continuity of reductive thinking about
terrorism against which Richter's October cycle was pitted, and by which interpretation of
September may be clouded. Contrary to Gibson's assertion terror is not indivisible. Moreover,
to observe that idealist sometimes devolve into destroyers is not to create a "moral equivalence"
between those who might kill and those who actually do, or to refuse to “distinguish between
good and evil, between civilization and barbarism.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, paintings Richter made in one context – a divided postwar Germany where years
of ideological polarization had put certain subjects off limits to serious scrutiny and frozen
people into permanently antagonistic positions on issues where scant factual certainty and no
clear consensus in terms of interpretation or judgement about key points of contention existed
– became emblems of a very different but comparably polarized context. That new context was
the United States in the aftermath of the first armed assault on its territory in generations, a
placewhere the main criteria for public discourse about that assault were being reduced to a
loyalty oath, even as that assault’s far reaching ramifications were just beginning to be glimpsed
and its true origins were just becoming known, not the least of those revelations being the Bush
administration’s utter failure to prepare for or prevent an attack it had been warmed by
intelligence sources was imminent.</p>
<p>For over fifty years , starting with the decolonizing of Algeria and the bombing campaigns of
the French paramilitary OAS and the Algerian revolutionary FLN (both of which killed
civilians in considerable numbers), Western democratic societies have had foreign and domestic
terrorists periodically staring them in the face. But they have also had the metamorphic,
metastatic specter of Terror on the brain, the latter signaling the broad propagandistic and
political impact of the more limited outrages of the former. At least twice, Richter has made
terrorism his explicit theme. The first time was in October 181 1977 (1988). The second is in
September (2005). Why? And if I have accurately sketched the meaning of the multipart
October cycle here and done so in greater detail in previous essays, what is the meaning of a
single, small, almost abstract depiction of one of the most consequential occurrences in recent
world history?</p>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<p>Now let us examine the picture closely. And while studying it, let us keep squarely in mind the
fact that the direct scrutiny of images is as contingent and as variable in the information it
provides as the direct scrutiny of events. No one sees exactly the same thing when they look at
the same thing because each viewer comes to the work differently prepared to look and does
his or her looking under different perceptual, cultural, and historical circumstances, whether or
not the work itself ever moves from one place to another. Moreover, let us not lose sight of the
fact that not only does the routine reproduction of images deplete what Walter Benjamin called
their "aura" which, contrary to the pervasive notion that aura is a golden glow that masterpieces
magically acquire in churches, stately mansions, or museums, consists instead of the vital
radiance apprehended by each individual spectator who is alert to a work's contingent
phenomenological state-in the case of paintings based on photographic sources, reproduction
effectively erases through further photomechanical reprocessing every detail or anomaly of
their surface, color, tone, and touch peculiar to the original. In short, it homogenizes all the bits
of painterly data that the painter has labored to introduce into or artfully elide with the purely
pictorial content provided by that photo source. There is no better demonstration of this effect
than in the reproduction of September (2005). Although an inadequate substitute for what has
been visually removed, verbal description functions as a means of partially restoring those who
have only catalogues and computer images to consult underestimate the subtlety and complexity
of the nearly monochrome canvas and drawing the wrong conclusion from it.</p>
Physically, September belongs to a fairly sizable body of work Richter has created over the last
decade or so, pieces that at a distance resemble gray smudges. Some of these paintings are large,
but most of moderate to small dimensions, September being in between the two lesser
proportions. That scale place it in the range of many of the media images people saw on
television at the time of the attack and since, while also countering the tendency in history
painting of representing major events in rhetorically big formats with melodramatic effect.
Furthermore after having initially rendered the full explosive power of the hijacked planes'
collision with the skyscraper in bold tones and colors Richter felt defeated as an artist by the
failure of his work to measure up to the vividness direct photo graphic documentation of that
collision achieved. Demoralized by this discrepancy Richter contemplated destroying the
painting altogether and in 2005 went so far as to tell a reporter from Der Spiegel who visited
his studio and saw the canvas in its original state over the artist's day bed that he was intending
to do so, or, as is his economical habit, just paint over the image on the way to making an
abstract picture.</p>
<p>Of the modestly scaled gray paintings which September partially resembles, some are densely
painted and the rest more lightly painted with September being perhaps the most sparsely
painted of all. Although it was executed in several layers only two now show on the surface.
The first is a sheer, semiporous skin of mottled pigment that covers the entire canvas, except
where it has been scraped or rubbed off, exposing the white primer underneath and the nap of
the linen underneath that. Atypically, for a Richter painting, those canceling strokes lift off the
initial coat, stop short of the outer margins and round out well inside of them, rather than
running straight across the surface and so subtly reinforce the centrality of image. This effect
was accomplished one evening with a knife rather than with Richter's customary squeegee or
spatula. He had been contemplating the painting for several days before deciding that such a
tool might be a solution to the problem. Nothing in the artist's 'work is routine no matter how
consistent some effects may superficially appear to the casual viewer, not even the choice of a
painterly “eraser”.</p>
<p>It is important, though, that the overall impression is roughly that of drumhead, stretched evenly
over the support without any gaps at the edges so that the field of vision is taut and roughly
uniform in tone and texture. As a result, anomalies and nuances that do exist read clearly as
being in tension with overall consistency of the pictorial space and of Righter’s touch. The
second layer consist of streaks, smears, and clots of pasty pigments whose tonal range is
generally broader than the undercoat and extends from milky grays and blues to creamy
anthracite aureoles. These impasto passages traverse the rectangle in opposite directions, going
from left to right in the upper half of the picture and from right to left in the lower half That
sense of contrary motion pulls at the surface and in painterly term, functions like “speed line "
in cartooning-but speed lines that emphasize contrary force, or possibly a single force pushing
out this way and that. Aside from this animating effect, the heavier paint serve, on the one hand,
to tress the canvas's immediate tactility and objectivity and, on the other simultaneously accents
and indexes the near dematerialization of the thinner layer and of the primary image just barely
bodied forth within it.</p>
<p>That image is faintly perceptible in the contrasting gray that dominate the canvas and in the
faint blush of colour that grows stronger as the viewer approaches, allowing the eye to acclimate
to the dim light that imbues the picture; for despite first appearance, it is a picture and not one
of Richter's monochrome abstraction, a Bild and not an Abstraktes Bild. The most visible
contrast is between the predominant grisaille and the pale cobalt blue zones that fill the lefthand side and central column of the image. For the rest, tones and tints permeate each other
while patches and tiny nodes of white percolate throughout in what may initially seem to be a
quasi-photographic dissolve, but which, to the viewer’s dreadful amazement, instead depicts an
entirely physical one.</p>
<p>That such a realization takes time is owed to the fact that image is at the very edge of being
recognizable, at that liminal point where the information it contains could be read any number
of ways and the mind must struggle to create a whole, or pictorial Gestalt, out of the diffuse,
ill-defined contours of the forms and the apparent coding of the colour. In sum, viewers must
mentally reconstitute a likeness that is in effect disintegrating before the eyes. In that way, the
processes of wet- into wet oil painting and Richter's long-standing practice of inpainting
(VermaIung in German) his pictures suck viewers into the vortex of the undoing of the image
and thus into the destruction of the WTC, for that is what they are looking at: the explosion of
United Airlines Flight 175 from Boston as it slammed into the South Tower.</p>
The more time spent with the painting the more fully that terrible knowledge dawns the viewer.
And the more easily that viewer will come to, see that the grays and blues in the middle of the
canvas are blended with brown flecked by muted red, yellow, and orange highlights, traces of
which can o be found in the lower left-hand side of the image, like flying sparks that glow hot
in the oxygenated atmosphere before they burn out and become cinder. That oblong zone of
warm tones amidst the cool grays and blue and those sparks are the exploding airplane. And as
we know from such images, the charred particles that filled the air around the towers and then
blew across the city were not only the byproduct of vaporized fuselage and building materials
but in large part the precipitate of some two thousand seven hundred and fifty-two lives, such
that the air those present inhaled was in some immeasurable proportion composed of the last
vestiges of those who had been incinerated at the site.</p>
<p>Again I must step forward, because such a macabre thought might not occur to anyone who
wasn't there, to anyone who has only looked at the pictures disseminated by the news media.
Yet, while seldom talked about, it was a thought in the back of the mind of almost everybody
ho breathed the air on that day and in the weeks after. The smell of burning bodies was masked
by the smell of burning plastic and other inorganic substances, but one knew that the nausea
ting scent was a composite including the, odors of a crematorium. Pictures have no smell, but
in the systematic scene, Richter’s rendition of 9/11/01 has the taste of ashes. To be sucked into
this picture also entails breathing atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the risk of taking the idea of synesthesia to the point of objectionably aestheticizing a charnel
house, I would add that Richter’s familiar way of blurring his image in this case adds
understanding to the subject he chosen to paint from a distance by opening meaningful gaps
between us and the onsite image we know so well that may have stopped thinking about them,
and, more allowing ourselves to engage emotionally.</p>
<p>To paint a suffocating, carnally polluted cloud over the silhouettes of the Twin Towers is one
method of evoking the all-encompassing, all-consuming deathliness of the event. And for those
who were there but out of self-protection have suppressed the memory, it is perhaps a way of
reconstituting it. To drag a dirty scrim across the image also takes the image out of contention
as a "realist" picture, that is, as a reliable purveyor of fact or, for that matter, as the vessel for
facts whose precise correlation can be questioned or challenged as interpretations. September
states nothing. Unlike October 18, 1977, not even the date implicit in the title, September 11,
appears in full, although it has sometimes been referred to by that misnomer. This is a figment
rather than a record of history. Compared with what eyewitnesses can recall even with the
passage of time and what video and photography have captured and preserved, Richter's
version-or, better said, vision-of 9/11/01 is an eroded representation of a monument blown to
smithereens, the ghost of a ghost.</p>
<p>Among the first dimension of reality – and of documentary art’s standard claims to truthfulness
– that is erased by Richter’s painterly methodology is time itself. Along with it goes the
photographic fiction of “ the decisive moment“ that encapsulates the essence of the people and
things arrested by the camera’s shutter.</p>
<p>Of course, the streaming of film and video image has long since undermined that idea, though
movie freeze frames and top-action images or instant-replay digital sequences have partially
sustained the notion at the level of forensic data. Here is the moment when it happened; the
moment when Kennedy died in his Dallas limousine, or the moment when his accused assassin
Lee Harvey Oswald took a bullet in a Dallas jail. But as these very examples argue, such images
prove nothing. Moreover, with or without subscribing to conspiracy theories even the most
credulous person studying these pictures I aware that the truth of those events does not reside
in their grainy detail . Neither does the truth of 9/11/01 lie in any of the pictures taken that day;
nor much less is it distilled in any single picture. Richter's blur makes that flux and
indeterminacy explicit. Once we have figured out that his painting focuses on the South Tower
when United Airlines Flight 175 hit, once we confirm that the impact was at 9:03 AM, and even
after searching for the source image and ascertaining when it comes in a sequence of images,
we still cannot pin down the exact second being portrayed.</p>
<p>For gruesome comparison, take Robert Capa's "decisive moment" photograph, Loyalist
Militiaman at the Moment’s of Death, Cerro Muriano, September 5, 1936, or Eddie Adams's
Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph, General; Nguyen Ngoc Loan Executing a Viet Cong
Prisoner in Saigon (1968). Both these images purport to represent the instant in which an
individual dies at the hand of another, and the latter one shows the hideous intimacy of that
shared moment. Richter's painting does no such thing, even though we know that the hijackers
of 9/11/01 and their victims died simultaneously. Collective death cannot be seized by the
camera and presented to the viewer as the dramatic climax of a conflict. The blast of a bomb
destroys many things, among them all possibility of narrating individual fates. This may in part
explain the horrid fascination of the picture we do have of people who leapt to their deaths from
the Twin Towers, for in those wreching pictures individuality and the existential finitude of
time is meaningfully incarnated by the postures and gestures of the doomed.Weapons of mass
destruction do indeed exist, but it would be seem to be beyond the ability of most human begins
– at any rate it is beyond my ability – to vicariously contemplate death when it has no face, no
body, no uniqueness. History tells us that this is why the majority of those who orchestrate mass
murder are able to do their job to drop bombs on invisible populations so as to make them
disappear definitively. Only the hardest, cruelest, most instinctually detached of men or woman
can kill large number at close range.</p>
<p>Richter's blurring of the explosion in the South Tower places gratification of any desire to see
and thereby seize death pictorially beyond the viewer's reach. It is painting rejoinder to a
photographic myth; painting's discretion counteracting the camera's voyeurism. Much has been
written in recent year about the motives and morality connected with photographically depicting
violence and suffering, David Levi-Strauss's Between the Eyes: says on Photography and
Politics and Susan Sontag's Regarding the Pain of Others being just two example. I will not go
into that literature here, except to suggest that throughout his career Richter has been asking
such questions in relation to his own medium-conflating artistic practice and to that extent his
work constitutes a corpus of critical thinking to which all discussions of these matters should
refer. In his case, reticence, specifically the decision not to paint what "cannot be painted," is
the principal means of critique. September is the signal test of that criteria and the signal
demonstration of Richter's principles. Yet for Richter, the highest aesthetic plane is the terrain
in which the ravages of the lowest states of the human condition can be made most piercingly
visible. To exquisitely paint an indescribably ugly subject is not to glamorize something
inherently odious but rather to call attention to it by showing tenderness toward something that
has been visited by brutality, and so make it harder if not impossible for the viewer to turn away
from the image once its subject has been recognized. To paint that image in such a manner as
to short – circuit its sensational charge and deny voyeuristic gratification in the spectacle that
charge transmit is to use the most sophisticated artifice to render the simple, absolute, but
always elusive reality of human suffering. This has been the formal predicate for all of Richter’s
artistic meditations on a war and terror. Thus, he was written:
Art has always has been basically about agony, desperation, and helplessness. (I am thinking
Crucifixion narratives, from the Middle Ages to Grunewald; but also of Renaissance portraits,
Mondrian and Rembrandt, Donatello and Pollock). We often neglect this site of things by
concentrating on the formal, aesthetic side in isolation. We no longer see content in form … the
fact is that content does not have a form (like a dress you can change): it is form (which cannot
be change). Agony, desperation, and helplessness cannot be presented except aesthetically,
because their source in the wounding of beauty. (Perfection).
Specifically, agony, desperation, and helplessness exploded in the horrible wounding of a fine
fall day. Richter flayed a delicately painted picture of that aggression so as to render a trauma
not only visible but palpable.</p>
<p>Speaking about the genesis of September to Hans Ulrich Obrist who, during the last decade,
has become his most frequent interlocutor (replacing Benjamin Buchloh in that capacity),
Richter compared the painting with an earlier suite of pictures painted in1989 that
commemorated the month that Communist authorities opened the wall between East and West
Germany – November 9 being the exact date – and the month following, during which the wall
was gradually demolished and the process of reunification initiated:
Apart from the elegant December, November, January, which have more black. The new picture
are more spontaneous, more abrasive, less aesthetic, and somewhat painful. The little picture
of the two towers was very colourful to start with, with the garish explosion beneath the
wonderful blue sky and the flying rubble. That couldn't work; only when I destroyed it, so to
speak, scratched it off, was it fit to be seen.</p>
<p>The "new pictures" to which Richter was referring were a series of twelve abstractions of a
generally dark, and, in his own words "abrasive, cast though it is hard to see January, December,
November (usually presented in reverse chronological order) as being in any sense "aesthetic"
to a fault. To the contrary, they are a remarkably somber counterpoint to the jubilation that was
typical of officially sanctioned reunification symbols. Having viewed the "economic miracle"
and cultural contradictions of the Federal Republic of Germany in the West with the same
scepticism that he had toward the unfulfilled utopianism of the German Democratic Republic
in the East, Richter remained unconvinced that two merged into one would be better.
Also, in the collection of the Museum of Modem Art, the dozen abstractions of 2005 are now
joined by their "photorealist" companion piece. Richter comments about their relationship
notwithstanding; it would be a mistake to read their turbulent, grating quality as being in any
way descriptive of the destruction of 9/11/01, any more than one should read such markings
and strident coloration as romantic Sturm and Drang in paintings of a more landscape-like
quality. Despite his attraction to Caspar David Friedrich, Richter has consistently eschewed any
return to the "pathetic fallacy" wherein human emotion is literally echoed in natural tumult, and
there is little ground for thinking that he would use abstraction as a sounding board for similar
explicitly manmade thunder and lightning. Moreover, from the scant evidence available about
the works in their early stages, they do not appear to have been painted over a realist image, as
has been the case on many occasions, and even less likely over a picture of the Twin Towers.
Even if such an image ls buried in one of the panels of the twelve-part suite, September stands
as the sole work in which the connection is objectively as well as subjectively inescapable.
Instead, it would seem from Richter's statement and the works themselves that a tense,
apprehensive, even apocalyptic mood pervades the paintings made at the time of September. In
that case, theylike October 18, 1977, are a delayed response to a powerful jolt to his system, an
aftershock rather than a direct transcription of the initial shock itself, reminding us that Richter
is, at his most emotional, a ruminative artist rather than an impetuous "expressionist."
Indeed, there is an element of puzzlement in the way Richter speaks of his having come around
to the subject four years after the attack itself, although the drawing for the painting apparently
hung in his studio as early as 2004. Still speaking to Obrist, Richter said:
Probably September II bothered me more than I expected. The big drawings also have
something to do with that theme; maybe at the time all the pictures did, even if you can't see
that now.</p>
<p>To what may we ascribe that slow realization? Moreover, what explains the fact that a theme
or awareness so important that it had somehow entered into all his pictures of that period can
only be seen in one of them now? The answer, I believe, lies in the very beginning of Richter's
mature life as a painter and in his formative years as a person.
Richter's professed ambivalence about the hot-button subjects he has often chosen comes
through clearly in his attitude toward September. In his exchange with Obrist he said:
Yes, but I am worried about exhibiting it. On the one hand, it's a perfectly harmless picture,
small, and not at all sensational. On the other, it has such a spectacular title, September II. I
should keep it, and Wit still looks alright, maybe I'll exhibit it one day later on.
There is certainly a measure of irony in this remark—or, some may argue, coyness —insofar
as it is not just the title but the subject itself that is spectacular; although, as previously noted,
the attack on the WTC was planned and executed by- AlQaeda to be a "spectacle" and Richter
bears no more responsibility for that dimension his image than anyone else who has recorded
or recycled it in one form or another. Quite the opposite: Richter went out of his way to muffle
the most spectacular aspect of the image—the fireball at the center—thereby de -
spectacualizing the scene to the degree that that is possible, much as he had done with the grisly
police photographs of Meinhof, Baader, and Ensslin tin death.</p>
<p>When first confronted by the problems of the "unpaintable” nature of certain images to which
he was nevertheless drawn, Richter' was to paint them and then destroy or cancel out the images,
or else to give them a trial run as altered photography and then refrain from painting them. The
examples of those he treated in this manner are consistently images of war. Perhaps the first is
a no - longer photomontage maquette for a painting from 1962 called Firing Squad. To the
repeated upside-down face of a Brigitte-Bardot-like blonde is juxtaposed a documentary picture
of men standing with raised hands before a firing squad. Who the men are is impossible to tell
from the image, but they seem to be wearing military uniforms, and their execution could be an
act of reprisal committed by the Nazis against partisans or soldiers opposing them or by
partisans and Allies who were fighting against Nazis. The Firing Squad is one of the rare
instances in which Richter resorted to the direct juxtaposition of disparate pictures, a method
that his close friend Sigmar Polke and his then geographically remote near contemporary Robert
Rauschenberg would use extensively for the sake of the unexpected meanings that such
dissonance revealed.</p>
<p>Still, for a few years in the early 1960s, the Neo-Dada methodologies of Polke and
Rauschenberg held a certain allure for Richter, and the follow-up to Firing Squad was an
exhibition conceived by Richter but never actually mounted in which the quasi-pornographic
pictures of pin-up he did paint in 1967 were to have been presented in the same space as
paintings of naked concentration camp prisoners in their barracks, he included that same year
in his omnium-gatherum of images, Atlas but never painted. The idea is simply appalling and
Richter know it. The dangling question is why did it occur to him, and why did it to him at that
particular time? Richter has said little on the matter, but context say a lot. These were the years
in which the everyday postwar silence in Germany about Nazi atrocities was finally broken.
Between 1963 and 1965, a German Federal Republic Court in Frankfurt held a second, much
publicized trial of middle-level SS officers charged Final crimes against humanity, the first
having taken place in Poland outside of German jurisdiction. The German proceedings followed
the Israeli 1960 capture and 1962 trial and execution of the architect of the Solution, Adolf
Eichmann, although German authorities had had the evidence against the defendants since
1958. Richter's aborted plan to jam one kind of "nudity" against another, one kind of "obscenity"
against another, belongs to a critical moment when both historical revelations and cultural
shock-tactics cracked the carapace of the New Germany to expose the hidden wreckage and the
untouched, still thriving remnants of Hitler's Germany harboured by it. By 1969, Atlas also
contained propaganda pictures of Hitler himself that Richter never painted. Previously, Richter
had copied onto canvas the likeness of Hitler in an oratorical spasm. Three times, in fact. The
first version was shown in 1964 at the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal in a group exhibition that
for the first and last time brought together the core of what later became known as the "Capitalist
Realism" contingent, Konrad Lueg (later Konrad Fischer), Sigmar Polke, and Richter. In that
painting, Hitler (1962), the Fuhrer appears from the chest up passionately gesticulating and
haranguing a crowd. The second and third time this stock image was called upon it was used in
a playing card-like composite of the same pose—Hitler as "king" or Hitler as "knave" on the
back of Stag (1963), and that composite is plainly recognizable under an incomplete coat of
white paint. Beginning with the October cycle, Richter thereafter abstained from painting
overtly sensational images that could readily be connected to the war or to political, violence,
with the partial exception of Herr Heyde (1965), the eponymous portrait of a furtive war
criminal arrested in Germany in 1959.</p>
<p>However, from the start of Richter’s career in West Germany, images of death and references
to the war and its destruction, albeit images that focus oil everyday mortality ordinary victims
rather than on great catastrophes and notorious villains.</p>
<p>Thus, starting with Coffin Bearers (1962) and Dead (1963), and on through Helga Matura with
her Fiancé and Helga Matura, both from 1966, (Matura, a prostitute, was a sex-murder victim)
and Eight Student Nurses, also from 1966, (the nurses were killed by Richard Speck in Chicago
that same year), Richter's iconography is replete with sinister subjects. The only person he
painted at this time and in this context who was famous other than as a victim was Jackie
Kennedy in Woman with Umbrella (1964); but here again, and in telling contrast to Warhol's
many paintings of the grieving Jackie, Richter picked a less than canonical source and never
named the subject. What links the equally anonymous dead in Coffin Bearers and Dead, women
who died at the hands of psychopaths, and the widow of an assassinated President? Bizarrely,
Speck himself provides something of an explanation. Born December 6, 1941, the clay before
America's entrance into World War II and the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, "a day
that shall live in infamy," in Franklin Roosevelt's resonant phrase, and the last time before
9/11/01 that a direct assault on the United States was launched within its territories, Speck told
a prison interviewer, “Day I Was born all Hell broke loose the next day. Hasn’t stopped since.
It hasn't. And it won't. The bloody trauma that was the twentieth century and is now the twentyfirst continues. In Richter's own life, the horrors came closest during the Allied bombing of
Germany in which the virtual obliteration of Dresden stands out as one of the most horrifying
examples prior to America's "conventional" bombing of Tokyo in 1945 and its use of atomic
weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Dresden was the city where his mother and father met
and where he had been born, and it was the ruin to which he returned after the fighting stopped
and he was ready to start his independent life. Moreover, Richter recalls hearing the thunder of
explosions in and around Dresden during the night of February 3, 1945, from the small town in
Saxony lived; although, given the distances involved, it is probable that what he heard were
radio broadcasts of the raids. The conflagration that resulted burned the core of the city to the
ground and incinerated between 24,000 and 40,000 people, the majority of them civilians. In
1951 when Richter returned to his birthplace from the countryside to attend the Dresden Art
Academy six years after the attack evidence of the devastation lay all around. "Everything had
been destroyed" he has said, "There were only piles of rubble to the left and right of what had
been the streets. Every, day we walked from the academy to the cafeteria through rubble, about
two kilometres there and back."</p>
<p>At the time of Dresden's near obliteration, Kurt Vonnegut, who is of German extraction, was a
twenty-three-year-old American prisoner of war under guard in "slaughterhouse-five," near the
heart of the city. Twenty-five years after the event, and following numerous attempts to recount
his experience, Vonnegut presented the story of the destruction of Dresden as a pseudo-memoir
interspersed with episodes of science fiction. In its first pages, published in 1969, he recalled:
Over the years, people I've met have often asked me what I'm working on and I've usually
replied that the main thing was a book about Dresden... It wasn't a famous air raid back then, in
America. Not many Americans knew how much worse it had been than Hiroshima, for instance.
I didn't know that either. I happened to tell a University of Chicago Professor at a cocktail party
about the raid, as I had seen it, about the books I would write. He was a member of something
called The Committee on Social Thought. And he told me about the concentration camps, and
about how the Germans had made soap and candles out of the fat of dead Jews and so on. And
all I could say was, "I know, I know, I know."9
Vonnegut had also seen a city and its citizens all but vanish in a hurricane of flames, leaving
behind the surreal predicate to his novel's literary conceit, a barren, lunar landscape all but
devoid of moon men. As viewed through the eyes of his fictional alter ego, Billy Pilgrim, "the
fire-bombing of Dresden" was, Vonnegut bluntly declared, "the greatest massacre in European
history."</p>
<p>Memories of the Allied air campaign and its Dresden paroxysm are the unpaintable" enormity
to which two other groups of pictures made by Richter unmistakably point. The first are
paintings of military aircraft in flight, beginning with Bombers (1963), in which high-altitude
planes with American insignia unload ribbons of steel-encased explosives on an invisible target.
Other pictures in the group include Stukas (1964) showing German dive bombers in action and
Mustang Squadron (also 1964), portraying American fighters buzzing the landscape beneath.
Referring to the same historical period, Airplanes (1964) would appear to be a view from the
ground up at anti-aircraft fire directed toward bombers flying overhead, whereas Jet Fighter
(1963), Phantom Interceptors Scharzler, and XL 513 (all 1964) feature supersonic jets of the
Cold War era.</p>
<p>The second series consists of aerial views of major cities views someone in the cockpit or bomb
bay of a warplane might have. Not that one would know from the image that the urban terrain
actually faced such a threat, and not that wounds have actually been opened in that terrain's
flesh. Indeed, a number of these Cityscapes resemble the sorts of promotional pictures that
developer’s commission to lure clients to their version of a no clean, prosperous and------above
all affordable utopia. By that token, some of the most stream- lined of these pictures way be
understood as trick mirrors reflecting and on Germany as it was rebuilt on the rubble of World
War II. But other works of this kind suggest the opposite outcome: the fall pulverization One
of the largest and earliest of the Cityscape series, Cathedral Square, Milan (1968), is not an
overview but rather a long vista encompassing the filigreed late-Gothic church and the
nineteenth-century commercial arcade; and it is painted in a striated manner that causes both
these "temples "—one dedicated to religion the other to commerce —to visibly shiver or shake.
The first full aerial views begin the same year and range in the degrees of resolution and stability
of the image from Cityscape .Madrid (1968), which is bathed in a crisp volume-defining
chiaroscuro light, to Cityscape Paris (196s), in which the buildings seem to be on the verge of
crumbling.</p>
<p>That apparent fragility reverberates throughout the picture. And, still more unnervingly in the
mind when one recalls the fate Hitler decreed for Pan's—or what Walter Benjamin its
quintessential and ultimately tragic flaneur, had called the "capital of the nineteenth century"—
should the city near surrender to the Free French and the Allies: namely total annihilation. Only
the refusal of the military Governor of Paris. General Dietrich von Choltitz, to obey the order
to level the city with explosives saved it. Then there are paintings like Cityscape PL (1970) in
the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, in which the viewer suspects that
some kind of fury has already been spent on the generally inchoate unidentifiable town at ninety
degrees to the eye. Lastly, after a pause of thirty years comes an oblique confirmation of
Richter's preoccupation with memories of aerial bombardment in the digitally reconfigured
appropriation of an Allied combat surveillance photo. Bridge, February 14, 1945 (2000) which
happened to be the last day of the air assault on Dresden, though this particular image shows a
bombed out stretch of the Rhine river as it passes through Cologne, where the artist now lives.
Characteristically, Richter is vague or evasive when asked point blank about the significance
of such specific and presumably meaningful details in his work. As essayist W. G. Sebald has
noted in his reflections on post-war reticence about Allied bombing, On the Natural History of
Destruction, such reactions are characteristic of a more general inhibition regarding the
experience that originates in German society's overall inability to come to terms with its wartime past. Virtually alone among artists of his generation Richter effectively broke that taboo
in pictures, but he has nevertheless hesitated to do so in words. When pressed in a 2001
interview with this author about the fact that many of his early pictures reference World War
II, Richter fended off questions about the import of particular images and protested that lie was
being "put on the couch."</p>
<p>But as any canny “patient” instinctively knowns, well-phrased disclaimers "patient"
instinctively knows, But as any canny may be the best way to lead the "analyst" past all but
unavowed taboos the 196os, he to unutterable truths. And so, when asked why, during painted
American warplanes flying over Germany, Richter replied, "But this painting--the American
bomb(er)—was forbidden. You were not allowed to take it seriously. You could only take it as
a joke." When I replied, "You didn't paint it as a joke," Richter's rejoinder was cagey but
revealing.</p>
<p>No, but I was satisfied that it was taken as such. I would have been embarrassed if it were too
serious. It was not an accusation; I was never accusing the American. I never wanted to accuse
anything, except maybe life and how shitty it is. But never ... after all, they were right.
Everything was fine (laughter)."</p>
<p>For Richter, the dilemma of painting the war would seem to have hinged on wanting to register
the enormity of the trauma he and his generation experienced without "taking sides" in a
situation where he could not in good conscience do so. As a nation, Hitler's Germany had
brought about its own destruction, but as someone who at a distance felt the impact of the
overwhelming counterforce unleashed upon his country, Richter could not stand apart from its
fate, either. To make "Pop" pictures of B-29s unloading their deadly cargo was thus to "make -
a joke" of something that was tragic because the context of the period made it impossible to see
tragedy in what seemed like just punishment in the eyes of those who had suffered the Nazi
onslaught, even as it seemed like arbitrary retribution to the civilians on whom the bombs rained
down. Richter was a less-than-innocent, less-than-guilty target among many other targets in a
war quite literally carried on over their heads. In a contest between armies who routinely
sacrifice non-combatants, the only honest Option for someone less innocent or, but less than
guilty for the excesses of his or her homeland is to be a candid witness of what happens when,
as Richter avers, life is "shitty" and violent death becomes the ineluctable centrepiece and
mystery of existence.</p>
<p>However, for reasons that should by now be self-evident, bearing witness does not imply special
access to the essential meaning of critical events. Nor does being in a position to see those
events with one's own eyes privilege the testimony of any individual, no matter where they
stand in relation to the presumed center of the drama, since so many other eyes are trained on
it from so many other uniquely revelatory positions. Logically, this observation is elementary,
but as soon as discussion moves from the abstract to the concrete, agreement vanishes in the
so-called "fog of war," that atmosphere of crisis and ambiguity in which opposites confront
each other only to lose their bearings, that moment of truth in which sharply defined antagonists
begin to resemble each other in their confusion and desperation and truth vaporizes and
indiscriminate death has the final word.</p>
<p>To say this is not to descend into moral relativism, despite what those who never doubt their
own righteousness may claim. Richter's unwillingness to accuse or excuse, his strict abstinence
from special pleading, and his refusal to create false equivalencies between what Germans did
to others and what Allied bombers did to Germans is in fact a staunch moral position, one
equivalent to Goya's harrowingly impartial declaration in the Disasters of War, "I saw this."
But as Goya's great indictment of the systematic terror perpetrated on the "benighted" Spaniards
by the "enlightened" troops of Napoleon's revolutionary army makes manifest, no one can
penetrate the darkness in which organized murder takes place on all sides. At best, we see just
a shadow of the worst.</p>
<p>Such ideological aberrations and the unforgivable cruelties they engender arc a constant—
arguably, the constant—of modernity, with bombing being zealotry's most advanced and
reliable technology (in the language of traditional anarchism, its "infernal engine" or, in that of
the nuclear era, its "ultimate weapon.") Accordingly, Terror is the name of every excess
committed for the sake of an abstraction as well as that of the barbarism prompted by intimate
hatreds and allegiances, whether those acts are perpetrated by a State or by insurgents, by
imperial armies or suicid individuals, by bureaucrats or truck drivers, by the haves or the
haven’t' In a more complete citation of Richter's previously quoted words on painting the
October cycle, one hears an intellectual refrain that seemingly anticipates the artist's return to
one of the themes that inform September
<p>That is the most impressive thing, to me, and the most inexplicable thing; that we produce ideas
which are almost always not only utterly wrong and nonsensical but also dangerous. Wars of
religion and the rest; it's fundamentally all about nothing, about pure blather—and we take it
utterly seriously, fanatically, even unto death."</p>
In the course of the agonizingly long conflicts within and among nations in the post-war, postcolonial era, the center of ideological gravity has shifted dramatically from "revolutionary
struggle" to "wars of religion," from a Cold War between entities ostensibly representing
Democracy and Communism, to the furious conflagrations sparked by what has been called a
"clash of civilizations" in some quarters and a "new Crusade" in others. To that extent,
September is a coda to the October cycle, the image of self-immolation in pursuit of selfdetermination, of a totalizing doctrine consummated by death.
But unlike the October cycle, in which Richter eschewed painting any pictures of the RAF's
victims, the haze of September subsumes those who suffered in the attack along with those who
perpetrated it. Furthermore, through abysmal dilation, it encompasses all who saw the attack
without having endured its worst effects. Finally, it envelops anyone who approaches it whether
or not they were awake that morning to watch what happened from any vantage point, near or
far. A focal point of thought that troubles the eye because of its small scale, indeterminate depth
of field, and lack of vanishing point, while troubling the mind by condensing every un-certainty,
contradiction, and ambivalence the viewer brings to it, September commemorates the events of
9/11 /01 as well as everything that led up to them and everything that has ensued since and
might be called a consequence, by holding all in perpetual suspension and irresolvable tension.
To think about that day you have only to look and by looking immerse yourself in and become
a part of that mantle of anxious ambiguity. By doing this, you will share it with those who still
wonder what happened and has yet and why, those who cannot stop asking themselves what
has been irrevocably changed or lost and what may yet be salvaged from the carnage and the
confusion. As a New Yorker who was "there," "then," to grow accustomed to the depth and
permanence of the trauma, my most urgent questions concern the degree to which my fellow
countermen have awakened from the illusion that "it can't happen here," and correspondingly,
the measure to which they have overcome the panic that drove them to abandon common sense
and common decency, while scorning their most cherished principle in the vain effort to
recreate an always irrational sense of invulnerability.</p>
<p>I don't know what Richter's foremost preoccupations in painting this work were, or what they
are now that it has found a home in the place where the Twin Towers once stood. I do know
more fully than ever before that our histories as people of different generations and different,
formerly antagonistic countries, as well as our fates as citizens of a ruthlessly fractured and
manipulated world, are inextricably entwined, and that the many meanings this picture has are
knotted into that mesh.</p>
